The majority of the active duty members (3,700) are stationed at the New London Submarine base. The New London Submarine base is the only Naval base in Connecticut, however it is a historic landmark because it was the very first U.S. submarine base to be built back in 1916. 

It sits on the Thames River just six miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean. Our records show that there are about 17 submarines currently at the New London base.

While the military presence in Connecticut is small, this area is an important location due to its close proximity to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and quick access to the Atlantic Ocean.

Currently there are only 11,000 active duty and reserve members currently serving at military bases in Connecticut. 

While this number may seem insignificant compared to other states with large military populations, don't overlook Connecticut as a possible location to be assigned. The state offers easy access to New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and the New England coast.
