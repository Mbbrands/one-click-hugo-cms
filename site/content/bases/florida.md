If you are in the Air Force or Navy it is likely that you may end up serving some time in Florida. With almost 100,000 active duty and reserve members, Florida military bases are a hotbed of activity.

Unlike California, Florida military bases are spread throughout the state. From the panhandle to the Gulf Coast, you'll find a military base along the way.
