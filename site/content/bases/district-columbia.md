Today there are quite a few military bases in the District of Columbia and the Washington DC area. These include bases for the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines and Navy.

The District of Columbia is home to 9800 active duty service members and over 4100 reserve members. It is also home to one of the oldest original Army base in the United States - Fort McNair.

Although the military bases in the District of Columbia are smaller than some others, they are in a strategic location with quick access to resources. Within a matter of hours military resources can be sent from cities like Philadelphia, PA or Richmond, VA.

It is also important to note that Washington, DC is where the White House and Pentagon are located. They are considered to be two of the most important command centers for the Department of Defense, employing almost 2,000 military civilians.
