<p>Think you have what it takes to be a Navy SEAL? Read through the requirements below and download our SEAL Challenge checklist.</p>

<p>Navy SEALs are a highly trained special operations force that executes missions on sea, air and land. Hence the name SEALs (Sea, Air, Land).</p>

In addition to the normal requirements to join the Navy, potential SEAL candidates will need to pass additional tests along the way. The rigorous training will take almost 3 years to complete from start to finish before you can be deployed into action as a Navy SEAL.

<ul>
<li>Open to both men and women</li>
<li>28 years of age or younger</li>
<li>U.S. citizen and eligible for security clearance</li>
<li>Pre-enlistment medical screening</li>
<li>Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)</li>
<li>Computerized-Special Operations Resilience Test (C-SORT)</li>
<li>Navy SEAL Physical Screening Test (PST)</li>
<li>8-week Naval Recruit Training</li>
<li>8-week Naval Special Warfare Prep School</li>
<li>24-week Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S)</li>
<li>5-week Parachute Jump School</li>
<li>26-week SEAL Qualification Training (SQT)</li>
<li>6-month Professional Development - Individual Specialty Training (ProDev)</li>
<li>6-month Unit Level Training (ULT)</li>
<li>6-month Squadron Integration Training (SIT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Requirements</h2>

<h2>Pre-enlistment medical screening</h2>

<h2>Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)</h2>

The ASVAB is used to assess an applicant's mental sharpness and ability to learn. The ASVAB is generally administered at a Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS).

<strong>The standard ASVAB contains the following subtests:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Word Knowledge (WK)</li>
<li>Arithmetic Reasoning (AR)</li>
<li>Mechanical Comprehension (MC)</li>
<li>Shop Information (SI)</li>
<li>Automotive Information (AI)</li>
<li>Electronics Information (EI)</li>
<li>Mathematics Knowledge (MK)</li>
<li>General Science (GS)</li>
<li>Paragraph Comprehension (PC)</li>
<li>Assembling Objects (AO)</li>
<li>Verbal Expression (VE) - a scaled combination of WK+PC</li>
</ul>

An additional line score, Coding Speed (CS), should be requested at MEPS, and the score can be included in the calculation to determine eligibility for the SEAL program. If the CS line score is not taken, only one set of line scores can be used to determine eligibility.

<strong>An applicant must score one of the following on the ASVAB:</strong>

<ul>
<li>GS + MC + EI = a minimum score of 170</li>
<li>VE + MK + MC + CS = a minimum score of 220</li>
<li>VE + AR = a minimum score of 110 and MC = a minimum score of 50</li>
</ul>

<h2>Computerized-Special Operations Resilience Test (C-SORT)</h2>

The Computerized-Special Operations Resilience Test, or C-SORT, is designed to assess a prospective SEAL candidate's mental toughness or resilience. The test includes multiple sections designed to assess a prospective candidate's abilities in three areas:

<ul>
<li>Performance strategies</li>
<li>Psychological resilience</li>
<li>Personality traits</li>
</ul>

Performance strategies test for capabilities such as a person's goal-setting, self-talk and emotional control. Psychological resilience focuses on assessing several other areas like an individual's acceptance of life situations and the ability to deal with cognitive challenges and threats.

The scores on the sections of this test are combined into a band score on a scale of one to four. A band score of four indicates that a candidate is most mentally resilient, and a one indicates the lowest level of mental resilience. 

<strong>Each prospective SEAL candidate can only take the C-SORT one time.</strong>

To determine eligibility for the SEAL program, the C-SORT band score is combined with a SEAL candidate's run and swim time. SEAL candidates who have a low C-SORT score and slow combined run and swim times will not be considered for SEAL contracts. Unqualified SEAL candidates will be counseled that they are not ready to pursue a career as a SEAL.

While candidates are not allowed to retake the C-SORT, a candidate can demonstrate their motivation by improving their PST score - particularly run and swim times - and re-taking the Delayed Entry Program qualifying Navy SEAL PST in order to move into the qualifying band to become eligible for a SEAL contract.
