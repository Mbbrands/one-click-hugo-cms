<p>Thinking about joining the Navy? You're not alone.</p>

<p>There are over 320,000 Active Duty personnel currently serving in this U.S. Navy. But don't worry, there are plenty of spots available for new recruits. In fact, the U.S. Navy adds about 40,000 new service members each year.</p>

<strong>So what are the enlistment requirements to join the Navy? Below we outline the minimum requirements including height, weight, age and physical fitness test scores.</strong>

<h2>Age Requirements</h2>

Did you know you can join the Navy when you are only 17 years old with parental consent?

Although it may be tempting to leave your troubles behind and start serving your country as a teenager, you might want to reconsider.

You see, even though you can join young you may have trouble working your way up to a higher pay grade without a college education. After you enlist in the Navy you will be competing against college graduates that are in their 20's for the best paying jobs.

Okay, so maybe you're not a teenager, but you are still thinking about joining the Navy. Believe it or not, there's a maximum age limit as well. 

You are not allowed to enlist if you are over 34 years old. However, if you have served in other branches of the military you may qualify to enlist if you are above the maximum age limit. Talk to your recruiter for more information.

<h2>Citizenship Requirements</h2>

Ready to proudly serve your country? Well, it might seem obvious but in order to join the U.S. Navy you must be a U.S. citizen.

Not sure if you are a citizen of this great country? According the the Fourteenth Amendment, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

You can also join the Navy if you are a resident alien. That includes anyone that is a permanent U.S. resident but is not a citizen. Simply put, a resident alien is someone who has a green card.

<h2>Education Requirements</h2>

Joining the Navy requires a high school diploma or GED.

As we mentioned before, although these are minimum education requirements to enlist, you will be competing against other recruits with a college education. 

In fact, in order to become an officer you will need to a 4-year college degree from an accredited university just to qualify. Not to mention, you'll need to meet a long list of other requirements.

If you haven't considered going to college, now might be the time to rethink your plans before enlisting in the Navy.

<h2>Height and Weight Requirements</h2>

According to a recent study, only 20% of potential military recruits will qualify to enlist based on their weight. Some even believe obesity is causing a national security issue. There is a growing trend of rejecting recruits because they are overweight and do not meet the minimum requirements to join the Navy.

<strong>Use the table below to see if you are below the maximum weight limit based on your height:</strong>
