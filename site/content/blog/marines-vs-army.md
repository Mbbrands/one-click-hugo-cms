The best part?

I'm going to show you the real difference between U.S. Army soliders and Marines without all the fluff.

In short: if you want to discover which branch of the armed services is the best, you're in the right place.

Let's get started.

<h2>What's the difference between the Marines and Army?</h2>

The main difference between the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army is their overall mission. Marines are responsible for air-ground operations with the assistance of the U.S. Navy. The Army is responsible for land-based military operations.

<h2>Size Comparison</h2>

The United States Army employs 476,179 active duty service members worldwide, making it the largest U.S. armed services division. There are an additional 335,204 Army National Guard members and 188,811 reserve soliders (as of September 2018).

The United States Marine Corps has a population of 185,415 active duty service members and 38,333 reserve Marines. The Marines Corps is the smallest U.S. armed services division, not counting the Coast Guard, which has only 42,000 members (as of Septmeber 2018).

<h2>Salary Comparison</h2>

Salaries in the military are standardized across all armed services divisions. That means someone with the same rank and experience will earn an identical salary whether they are in the Army or Marines. Military pay charts are available to the public and are updated annually.

One way to earn more money in the military is through increased housing allowances based on your location. For example, military members located in San Diego, CA earn more than those in Idaho due to the increased cost of living in Southern California. Service members can also earn more by taking advantage of special singing bonuses.

The United States Army and Marine Corps offer a wide range of signing bonuses to fill jobs that are in high-demand. Re-enlistment bonuses are also used to encourage experienced officers to extend their careers with the U.S. military.

<strong>Examples of Army enlistment bonuses:</strong>

<ul>
<li>$10,000 bonus after completing the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP)</li>
<li>$16,000 bonus for shipping to training within 30-days of enlistment</li>
<li>$18,000 bonus for enlisting as a Human Intelligence Collector (35M)</li>
<li>$27,000 bonus for enlisting as a PATRIOT Fire Control Enhanced Operator/Maintainer (14E)</li>
<li>$65,000 toward repayment of your current outstanding student loan debt</li>
</ul>

<strong>Examples of Marine enlistment bonuses:</strong>

<ul>
<li>$10,000 early re-enlistment bonus</li>
<li>$20,000 bonus for air traffic controllers</li>
<li>$20,000 re-enlistment bonus for Marine Security Guard Detachment Commanders</li>
<li>$30,000 bonus for infantry squad leaders</li>
<li>$40,000 bonus for counter-intelligence/human intelligence specialists</li>
</ul>

Note: Please contact a recruiter to learn more about bonus availability and requirements.
