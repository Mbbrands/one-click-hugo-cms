<p>Before you get shipped off to Army Basic Training, you'll probably want to know how long you'll be there and what you will be required to do.</p>

<p>Basic Combat Training or Boot Camp is a 10-week training course designed to turn ordinary men and women into exceptional U.S. soldiers.</p>

While at Basic Training new Army recruits will train for 12-14 hours a day, Monday through Saturday. Sunday is reserved for religious services and personal time.

A few highlights include taking the Army Physical Fitness Test multiple times, learning to march and being issued your own M16A4.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

However, at the end of boot camp each new soldier will be well prepared to serve their country with confidence and pride.
