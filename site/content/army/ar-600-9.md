<h2 id="chap3">Chapter 3 Army Body Composition Program</h2>

<h3 id="3-1">3–1. Overview</h3>

Soldiers are subject to many demands and challenges that may impact individual readiness. The ABCP provides commanders a systematic approach to enforce military standards across the unit, while supporting Soldiers with the resources they need to return to an optimum level of individual readiness.

<h3 id="3-2">3–2. Standard</h3>

a. Soldiers are required to meet the prescribed body fat standard, as indicated in appendix B. Soldiers will be screened every 6 months, at a minimum, to ensure compliance with this regulation.

b. The only authorized method of estimating body fat is the circumference-based tape method outlined in appendix B.

c. Commanders are authorized to use the weight for height table (see app B) as a screening tool in order to expedite the semi-annual testing process. If Soldiers do not exceed the authorized screening table weight for their age and measured height, no body fat assessment is required.

d. Commanders have the authority to direct a body fat assessment on any Soldier that they determine does not present a Soldierly appearance, regardless of whether or not the Soldier exceeds the screening table weight for his or her measured height.

e. Soldiers identified as exceeding the body fat standard will be flagged in accordance with AR 600–8–2 and enrolled in the ABCP. They must meet the body fat standard in this regulation in order to be released from the program.

<h3 id="3-3">3–3. Exemptions</h3>

a. Soldiers assigned or attached to a Warrior Transition Unit or Community Based Warrior Transition Unit must meet the body fat standard. Soldiers with special considerations may request a temporary exception to policy. See paragraph 3–17.

b. The following Soldiers are exempt from the requirements of this regulation; however, they must maintain a Soldierly appearance:

(1) Soldiers with major limb loss. Major limb loss is defined as an amputation above the ankle or above the wrist, which includes full hand and/or full foot loss. It does not include partial hand, foot, fingers, or toes.

(2) Soldiers on established continued on active duty and/or continued on active Reserve status. See AR 635–40.

(3) Pregnant and postpartum Soldiers. See paragraph 3–15.

(4) Soldiers who have undergone prolonged hospitalization for 30 continuous days or greater. See paragraph 3–16.

(5) New recruits. These recruits, regardless of component, will have 180 days from entry to active service to meet the retention body fat standards established in this regulation. Failure to achieve retention body fat standards at 180 days will result in Soldiers being flagged in accordance with AR 600–8–2 and enrolled in the ABCP.

c. Soldiers that do not meet the criteria of paragraph b, above have the option to request a temporary exception to policy. See paragraph 3–17.

<h3 id="3-4">3–4. Weigh-in and body fat assessment</h3>

a. Weigh-ins and body fat assessments will be conducted in accordance with appendix B. All Soldiers will be weighed every 6 months, at a minimum.

b. In order to ensure the ABCP does not interfere with Soldier performance on the APFT, commanders and supervisors are encouraged to allow a minimum of 7 days between APFT and weigh-in, if feasible. Some Soldiers that are close to exceeding the screening weight may attempt to lose weight quickly in the days leading up to a weigh-in.

This practice may result in the Soldier being unable to perform his or her best on the APFT, if the two events are scheduled close together.

c. Routine weigh-ins will be accomplished at the unit level. Percent body fat assessments will be accomplished by company or similar level commanders (or their designee) in accordance with standard methods prescribed in appendix

B. Soldiers will be measured by trained individuals of the same gender. If a trained individual of the same gender is not available to conduct the measurements, a female Soldier will be present when a male measures a female, and a male Soldier will be present when a female measures a male. IRR members on annual training, ADT, and special ADT will have a weigh-in and body fat assessment (if required) by the unit to which they are attached.

d. Units maintain height, weight, and body fat assessment data according to unit policy. The height, weight, and body fat percent may be entered on the Department of the Army (DA) Form 705 (Army Physical Fitness Test Scorecard) but they are no longer required entries. Units may track height and weight on a centralized roster, the DA Form 705, and on the DA Form 5500 (Body Fat Assessment Worksheet - Male) or DA Form 5501 (Body Fat Assessment Worksheet - Female) if a body fat assessment is required.

<h3 id="3-5">3–5. Enrollment in the Army Body Composition Program</h3>

a. Active Army and RC Soldiers who exceed body fat standards in appendix B will be enrolled in the unit ABCP. Enrollment in the ABCP starts on the day that the Soldier is notified by the unit commander (or designee) that he or she has been entered in the program (see para 3–6 for guidance on notification counseling).

b. While enrolled, Soldiers will be provided exercise guidance by the unit master fitness trainer and/or unit fitness training NCO in accordance with FM 7–22; nutrition counseling by registered dietitian (or health care provider, if a dietitian is not available); and assistance in behavioral modification, as appropriate, to help them attain the requirements of the Army.

c. Initial entry Soldiers who exceed body fat standards after 180 days from date of entry to active service will be entered in the ABCP and flagged under the provisions of AR 600–8–2 by the unit commander.

<h3 id="3-6">3–6. Actions, counselings, and evaluations for Active Component and Reserve Component Soldiers on active duty</h3>

<strong>The following actions are required when a Soldier is determined to be exceeding the body fat standard (see table 3–1):</strong>

<strong>a. Notification counseling.</strong> In accordance with AR 600–8–2, the commander has 3 working days to Flag the Soldier using DA Form 268 (Report to Suspend Favorable Personnel Actions (FLAG)) and 2 working days from initiation of DA Form 268 to counsel and/or notify and enroll the Soldier in the ABCP. The effective date of the DA Form 268 flagging action is the date that the Soldier is found to be noncompliant. Notification counseling documentation will be completed in accordance with figure 3–1. During this notification counseling, Soldiers will be advised they—

(1) Have a DA Form 268 placed on their record to suspend favorable personnel actions. Some of the ramifications of the flagging action include:

(a) Are nonpromotable (to the extent such nonpromotion is permitted by law).

(b) Will not be assigned to command, command sergeant major, or first sergeant positions.

(c) In accordance with AR 350–1, are not authorized to attend military schools and institutional training courses.

(2) Are enrolled in the ABCP effective immediately. While enrolled they—

(a) Must read the online U.S. Army Public Health Command (USAPHC) Technical Guide (TG) 358 within 14 days of enrollment and schedule an appointment with a dietitian, if available, or health care provider.

(b) Must complete and return their Soldier Action Plan (refer to para b, below) to the commander within 14 days of the notification counseling.

(c) Are required to meet with a dietitian or health care provider within 30 days of enrollment in the ABCP, bring a copy of the commander’s request for nutrition counseling (fig 3–2) and their Soldier Action Plan to the dietitian for review, and provide the commander a memorandum signed by the dietitian (or health care provider if a dietitian is not available) verifying that the nutritional counseling took place.

(d) Must participate in unit monthly ABCP assessments to document their progress.

(e) Must meet the body fat standard in order to be released from the ABCP.

(f) Must demonstrate satisfactory progress, as defined in paragraph 3–9b, while enrolled in the ABCP and understand that failure to do so will result in bar to reenlistment or initiation of separation proceedings.

(g) May request a medical examination if there is reason to believe that there is an underlying medical condition that may be the direct cause of weight gain or the direct cause of the inability to lose weight or body fat.

(3) Must acknowledge enrollment in the ABCP by memorandum to the commander (see fig 3–3) within 2 working days of notification of enrollment.

<strong>b. Soldier Action Plan.</strong> Within 14 days of the notification counseling, the Soldier will respond to the commander with a Soldier Action Plan confirming that he or she has read USAPHC TG 358, provide date and time of scheduled nutrition counseling, and indicate what approach he or she intends to use to work towards meeting the body fat standard. As a part of the Soldier Action Plan, the Soldier must complete the Army MOVE!23 (http://usaphcapps.amedd.army.mil/move23/register.asp) interactive questionnaire, review the survey results, and record the retrieval code. During the nutrition counseling, the Soldier should provide this retrieval code to the dietitian or health care provider to enable him or her to review the Soldier’s responses and provide feedback. The Soldier has the option to modify his or her plan while enrolled in the ABCP (for example, a Soldier may initially opt to follow a commercial weight loss program, but then 2 months later decide to enroll in a no-cost internet-based program). A sample Soldier Action Plan is at figure 3–4.

<strong>c. Nutrition counseling.</strong> The Soldier has 30 days after enrollment in the ABCP to meet with a dietitian (or health care provider, if a dietitian is not available) to receive nutrition counseling. Soldiers will schedule this appointment and coordinate any absence with their supervisory chain. Soldiers will provide the commander a memorandum signed by a dietitian or health care provider verifying that the nutrition counseling took place. A sample memorandum is at figure 3–5.

<h3 id="3-7">3–7. Actions, counselings, and evaluations for Reserve Component Soldiers not on active duty</h3>

<strong>The following is required when a Soldier is determined to exceed the body fat standard (see table 3–1):</strong>

<strong>a. Notification counseling.</strong> In accordance with AR 600–8–2, the commander has until the final unit training assembly of that weekend’s multiple unit training assembly (MUTA) to Flag the Soldier using DA Form 268. Soldiers will be counseled regarding the initiation of the DA Form 268 prior to the conclusion of the first training period following the date the flagging action was initiated in accordance with AR 600–8–2. The effective date of the flagging action is the date the Soldier is found to be noncompliant. During this notification counseling, Soldiers will be advised they—

(1) Have a DA Form 268 placed on their record to suspend favorable personnel actions. Some of the ramifications of the flagging action include:

(a) Are nonpromotable (to the extent such nonpromotion is permitted by law).

(b) Will not be assigned to command, command sergeant major, or first sergeant positions.

(c) In accordance with AR 350–1, are not authorized to attend military schools and institutional training courses.

(2) Are enrolled in the ABCP effective immediately. While enrolled they—
(a) Must read the USAPHC TG 358 within 14 days of enrollment. An appointment with a dietitian is optional at the Soldier’s own expense.

(b) Must complete and return their Soldier Action Plan (refer to para b, below) to the commander prior to the conclusion of the first training period after being notified of enrollment in the ABCP.

(c) Must participate in unit monthly ABCP assessments to document their progress.

(d) Must meet the body fat standard in order to be released from the ABCP.

(e) Must demonstrate satisfactory progress, as defined in paragraph 3–9b, while enrolled in the ABCP and understand that failure to do so will result in bar to reenlistment, initiation of separation proceedings, or a transfer into the IRR.

(f) May request a medical examination if there is reason to believe that there is an underlying medical condition that may directly contribute to weight gain or prevent weight or body fat loss. This exam is at the Soldier’s own expense.

(3) Must acknowledge enrollment in the ABCP by memorandum to the commander (see fig 3–3) no later than the following MUTA after the notification of enrollment.

<strong>b. Soldier Action Plan.</strong> At the next scheduled MUTA following ABCP enrollment notification counseling, Soldiers will respond to the commander with a Soldier Action Plan confirming that they have read USAPHC TG 358. As a part of the Soldier Action Plan, Soldiers must complete the Army MOVE!23 (http://usaphcapps.amedd.army.mil/move23/register.asp) interactive questionnaire, review the survey results, and record their retrieval code. The retrieval code is to be recorded in the event the Soldiers choose to review the results with a dietitian or health care provider during a nutrition counseling appointment. Soldiers have the option to modify their plan while enrolled in the ABCP (for example, a Soldier may initially opt to follow a commercial weight loss program, but then 2 months later decide to enroll in a no-cost internet-based program). A sample Soldier Action Plan is at figure 3–4.

<strong>c. Nutrition counseling.</strong> This is optional at the Soldier’s own expense.

<h3 id="3-8">3–8. Administrative requirements</h3>

Commanders must maintain an ABCP file at the unit on each Soldier enrolled in the program. Each file must include, at a minimum, the following for each enrollment:

a. DA Form 268 initiating the flagging action.

b. DA Form 5500 or DA Form 5501 from enrollment and each monthly assessment.

c. Notification counseling (see fig 3–1).

d. Soldier Action Plan (see fig 3–4).

e. Nutrition counseling results memorandum (AC and RC on active duty only) (see fig 3–5).

f. Medical evaluation request memorandum(s), if indicated (AC and RC on active duty only) (see fig 3–6).

g. Medical evaluation results, if indicated (AC and RC on active duty only) (see fig 3–7).

h. Release from ABCP counseling memorandum from the unit commander (see fig 3–8).

i. Copy of DA Form 3349 (Physical Profile), if indicated.

<h3 id="3-9">3–9. Monitoring Soldier progress in the Army Body Composition Program</h3>

a. Approximately every 30 days (or during unit assemblies for RC not on active duty), commanders will conduct a monthly ABCP assessment to measure Soldier progress, with results annotated on DA Form 5500 or DA Form 5501. During monthly assessments, every Soldier enrolled in the ABCP will be weighed and have a body fat assessment conducted in order to document weight and fat loss progress.

b. A monthly loss of either 3 to 8 pounds or 1 percent body fat are both considered to be safely attainable goals that enable Soldiers to lose excess body fat and meet the body fat standards. Soldiers that meet either of these goals are considered to be making satisfactory progress in the ABCP.

c. When necessary, commanders and supervisors will provide additional support, guidance, and resources to enhance Soldier’s success. This may include time to participate in ongoing nutritional counseling or weight loss programs as prescribed by the dietitian or healthcare provider. Helpful tips for commanders and supervisors are located in appendix C.

<h3 id="3-10">3–10. Medical evaluation</h3>

a. A medical evaluation is required when:

(1) Requested by the unit commander.

(2) Requested by the Soldier (at own expense for RC Soldier not on active duty).

(3) Soldier is being considered for separation for failure to make satisfactory progress in the ABCP (applies to AC and RC on active duty only).

(4) Soldier is within 6 months of expiration term of service after the initiation of a reenlistment bar for failure to make satisfactory progress in the ABCP.

b. The health care provider will conduct a medical evaluation to ensure the Soldier can participate in the ABCP and rule out any underlying medical condition that may be a direct cause of significant weight gain or directly inhibit weight or body fat loss. If an underlying medical condition is found, the following applies:

(1) If the medical condition is temporary and can be controlled with medication or other medical treatment and meets the retention standards of AR 40–501, the health care provider will—

(a) Initiate treatment.

(b) In accordance with AR 40–501, prepare a temporary profile in the e-Profile application within the Medical Operational Data System (MODS) (https://apps.mods.army.mil) listing any functional limitations that would prevent the Soldier from fully participating in the ABCP.

(c) Complete the memorandum (fig 3–7) and return to the commander for enrollment in the ABCP.

(d) Refer to appropriate specialist for nutritional and exercise counseling.

(e) RC personnel not on active duty may choose to self-refer to their personal physician (at their own expense) for further evaluation or treatment.

(2) If the medical condition does not meet medical retention standards of AR 40–501 (see medical fitness standards for retention and separation, including retirement) the health care provider will refer the Soldier to a medical evaluation board.

c. Aircraft crewmembers exceeding the body fat standards will be referred to a flight surgeon for medical evaluation and determination of impact on flight status.

d. Health care providers will not use the e-Profile application within the MODS (https://apps.mods.army.mil) to recommend exemption from ABCP for temporary medical conditions. Health care providers will use the medical evaluation results memorandum (fig 3–7) for this purpose.

<h3 id="3-11">3–11. Temporary medical condition</h3>

a. All Soldiers found to exceed the allowable body fat standard will have a DA Form 268 initiated and be enrolled in the ABCP.

b. Soldiers found to have a temporary medical condition that directly causes weight gain or prevents weight or body fat loss will have up to 6 months from the initial medical evaluation date to undergo treatment to resolve the medical condition. The medical specialty physician may extend the time period up to 12 months if it is determined more time is needed to resolve the medical condition. During this time, the Soldier will participate in the ABCP, to include initiation of a DA Form 268, nutrition counseling, and monthly body fat assessment, but will not be penalized for failing to show progress. However, if the Soldier meets the body fat standard during this timeframe, he or she will be removed from the ABCP.

c. The provisions of this paragraph are not applicable to medical conditions or injuries based solely on a prescribed reduction in physical activity. The inability to exercise does not directly cause weight gain. Health care personnel will advise Soldiers to modify caloric intake when reduced physical activity is necessary as part of a treatment plan.

d. Once the medical condition is resolved, or 6 months (not to exceed 12 months), whichever occurs first, from the date of the medical evaluation, and if the Soldier still exceeds the body fat standard, he or she will continue participating in the ABCP but will be required to show satisfactory progress, as defined in paragraph 3–9b. Health care providers will forward to the Soldier’s commander an updated memorandum stating the effective date that the Soldier’s temporary medical condition is resolved.

e. If the Soldier is unable to show satisfactory progress in accordance with paragraph 3–9b, the Soldier will be subject to separation.

<h3 id="3-12">3–12. Program failure</h3>

a. Satisfactory progress in the ABCP is defined as a monthly weight loss of either 3 to 8 pounds or 1 percent body fat.

b. A Soldier enrolled in the ABCP is considered to be failing the program if:

(1) He or she exhibits less than satisfactory progress on two consecutive monthly ABCP assessments; or

(2) After 6 months in the ABCP he or she still exceeds body fat standards, and exhibits less than satisfactory progress for three or more (nonconsecutive) monthly ABCP assessments.

c. When a Soldier has failed the program, the commander will request a medical evaluation.

(1) If the medical evaluation finds the Soldier has a medical condition that does not meet medical retention standards of AR 40–501 (see medical fitness standards for retention and separation, including retirement) the Soldier will be processed in accordance with AR 40–501 (see chap 3, disposition).

(2) If the Soldier is found to have a temporary underlying medical condition that directly causes weight gain or prevents weight or body fat loss, the commander will follow the requirement in paragraph 3–11b.

(3) If the medical evaluation finds no underlying medical condition, then the commander will initiate separation action, bar to reenlistment, or involuntary transfer to the IRR for RC Soldiers in accordance with AR 140–10.

(4) For RC personnel not on active duty only, if the individual has not obtained an evaluation from his or her personal physician under the provisions of paragraph 3–7a(2)(f) and cannot demonstrate that the overweight condition results from an underlying or associated disease process, the individual may be separated under appropriate regulations without further medical evaluation by health care personnel.

d. The commander or supervisor will inform the Soldier, in writing, that a bar to reenlistment, separation action, or a transfer to the IRR is being initiated under the following applicable regulation(s): AR 135–175; AR 135–178; AR 600–8–24 (see eliminations and miscellaneous types of separations); AR 601–280; AR 635–200; AR 140–10; National Guard Regulation (NGR) (AR) 600–5; NGR 600–101; NGR 600–200; or NGR 635–100.

<h3 id="3-13">3–13. Release from the Army Body Composition Program</h3>

a. Commanders and supervisors will remove individuals administratively from the ABCP as soon as the body fat standard is achieved. Soldiers that meet the screening table weight must remain in the ABCP program until they no longer exceed the required body fat standard.

b. The commander will remove the DA Form 268 actions and counsel the Soldier on the importance of maintaining body composition and potential consequences if re-enrolled in the program within 36 months. A sample memorandum of release from ABCP counseling is at figure 3–8.

<h3 id="3-14">3–14. Body fat assessment failure within 36 months of release from Army Body Composition Program</h3>

a. If a Soldier again exceeds the body fat standard within 12 months after release from the ABCP, a DA Form 268 will be initiated on the Soldier. The Soldier will undergo a medical evaluation (at own expense for RC not on active duty).

(1) If the Soldier is found to have a temporary medical condition that prevents weight or body fat loss, the commander will follow the requirements of paragraph 3–11.

(2) If no underlying medical condition is found, the commander will initiate separation action, bar to reenlistment, or transfer to the IRR per paragraph 3–12d.

b. If, after 12 months but less than 36 months from the date of release from the ABCP, it is determined that a Soldier again exceeds the body fat standard, a DA Form 268 will be initiated on the Soldier. The Soldier will undergo a medical evaluation (at own expense for RC not on active duty).

(1) If the Soldier is found to have a temporary medical condition that prevents weight or body fat loss, the commander will re-enroll the Soldier in the ABCP under the requirements of paragraph 3–11.

(2) If no underlying medical condition is found, the commander will re-enroll the Soldier in the ABCP. The Soldier will have 90 days to meet the standards. Soldiers who meet the body fat standard at the 90-day point will be released from the ABCP. Soldiers who do not meet the ABCP body fat standard at the 90-day point are considered ABCP failures. Commanders will initiate separation action, bar to reenlistment, or transfer to the IRR per paragraph 3–12d for all Soldiers who fail to meet the body fat standard at the 90-day point.

<h3 id="3-15">3–15. Pregnancy</h3>

a. Personnel who meet this regulation’s standards and become pregnant will be exempt from the standards for the duration of the pregnancy plus the period of 180 days after the pregnancy ends. If, after this period of exemption they are verified to exceed the body fat standard, they will be enrolled in the ABCP, pending approval of a medical doctor that they are fit to participate in the program.

b. Soldiers who become pregnant while enrolled in the ABCP will remain under the flagging action.

c. Soldiers entered or re-entered in the ABCP after pregnancy will be considered first-time entries into the program; paragraph 3–14 will not apply at that time.

d. If the Soldier is determined to exceed the body fat standard and is identified to have a temporary underlying medical condition, refer to paragraph 3–11 for appropriate actions.

<h3 id="3-16">3–16. Hospitalization</h3>

Personnel who meet this regulation’s standards and are hospitalized for 30 continuous days or more will be exempt from the standards for the duration of the hospitalization and the recovery period as specified by their profile, not to exceed 90 days from discharge from the hospital. If at the end of the specified recovery period the Soldier exceeds the allowable body fat standard, a DA Form 268 will be initiated on the Soldier and he or she will be enrolled in the ABCP.

<h3 id="3-17">3–17. Exception to policy authority</h3>

a. The DCS, G–1 is the approval authority for all exceptions to this regulation. All requests for an exception to this policy will include an endorsement from a medical professional and be processed through the Soldier’s chain of command, with recommendations as to disposition from the company, battalion, and brigade-level commanders, reviewed by the servicing staff judge advocate, and submitted directly to Deputy Chief of Staff, G–1 (DAPE–HR), 300 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310–0300 for final determination.

b. The use of certain medications to treat an underlying medical or psychological disorder or the inability to perform all aerobic events may contribute to weight gain but are not considered sufficient justification for noncompliance with this regulation. Medical professionals should advise Soldiers taking medications that may contribute to weight gain, or Soldiers with temporary or permanent physical profiles, that they are still required to meet the body fat standard established in the regulation; the Soldier may be referred to an appropriate specialist for nutrition and exercise counseling as indicated.

c. Chronic medical conditions will not be used to exempt Soldiers from meeting the standards established in this regulation.

d. There are no exemptions to the provisions of this regulation based solely on race, ethnicity, or gender.

<h3 id="3-18">3–18. Reenlistment criteria</h3>

a. Personnel who exceed the body fat standard in appendix B will not be allowed to reenlist or extend their enlistment.

b. Exceptions to policy for Active Army personnel (including RC personnel on active duty) are prescribed in this subparagraph. For Soldiers who are otherwise physically fit and have performed their duties in a satisfactory manner, the commander exercising General Court Martial Convening Authority or the first general officer in the Soldier’s normal chain of command (whichever is in the most direct line to the Soldier) may approve the following exceptions to policy:

(1) Extension of enlistment may be authorized for personnel who meet one of the following criteria:

(a) Individuals who have a temporary medical condition that directly precludes loss of weight or body fat. In such cases, the type of ongoing treatment will be documented and the extension will be for the minimum time necessary to correct the condition and achieve the required weight or body fat loss.

(b) Pregnant Soldiers (except those Soldiers who have medical conditions as listed in para 3–15d) who are otherwise fully qualified for reenlistment, including those with approved exception to policy, but who exceed acceptable standards prescribed in this regulation, will be extended for the minimum period that will allow birth of the child, plus 7 months. A clearance from the doctor that the Soldier is medically fit to participate in the ABCP is required. Authority, which will be cited on DA Form 1695 (Oath of Extension of Enlistment) is AR 601–280 (see determination of qualifications). On completion of the period of extension, the Soldier will be reevaluated under paragraph 3–15.

(2) Exceptions to policy allowing reenlistment and/or extension of enlistment are authorized only in cases where medically documented conditions (see para 3–11) preclude attainment of required standards.

c. All requests for extension of enlistment for ARNG and USAR (troop program unit and IRR) personnel not on active duty will be processed under NGR 600–200 or AR 140–111 (see extending enlistment or reenlistment agreements), as appropriate.

d. Requests for exceptions to policy will be forwarded through the chain of command, with the commander’s personal recommendation and appropriate comment at each level. 

<strong>As a minimum, requests will include:</strong>
<ul>
<li>(1) The physician’s evaluation.</li>
<li>(2) A record of progress in the ABCP.</li>
<li>(3) Current height and weight.</li>
<li>(4) Current body fat assessment results.</li>
<li>(5) Years of active Federal service.</li>
<li>(6) Other pertinent information.</li>
</ul>

e. Soldiers who have completed a minimum of 18 years of active Federal service may, if otherwise eligible, be extended for the minimum time required to complete 20 years active Federal service. Retirement must be accomplished no later than the last day of the month in which the Soldier attains retirement eligibility. Application for retirement will be submitted at the time extension is authorized. Approval and/or disapproval authority is outlined in AR 601–280.

f. USAR Soldiers who have completed a minimum of 18 years of qualifying service for retired pay at age 60 may be extended for the minimum time required to complete 20 years qualifying service. Approval and/or disapproval authority is outlined in AR 140–111. Transfer to the IRR or Retired Reserve or discharge will be accomplished at the end of the retirement year in which the Soldier attains the 20 qualifying years.

g. ARNG Soldiers who have completed a minimum of 18 years qualifying service for retired pay at age 60 may be extended for the minimum time required to complete 20 years qualifying service by the State Adjutant General; disapproval authority is the Secretary of the Army. Transfer to the IRR or Retired Reserve or discharge will be accomplished at the end of the retired year in which the Soldier attains the 20 qualifying years.
