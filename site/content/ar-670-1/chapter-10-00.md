<h4 id="10-6">10-6: General guidelines</h4>

a. The food service uniform is worn with the smock tucked into the trousers. The commander may authorize exceptions to the prescribed wear of the smock for health and safety reasons. The black belt with black open-faced buckle is worn with this uniform. The food handler’s apron and food handler’s caps are worn only within the immediate vicinity of the dining facility. No insignia is worn on the food handler’s cap. Soldiers will wear the food handler’s cap only while in the dining facility.

b. The optional purchase, white unisex cardigan is authorized for wear as an outer garment with the food service uniform while on duty. However, Soldiers may not wear the white cardigan when serving or preparing food. Soldiers may wear the white unisex cardigan buttoned or unbuttoned while indoors; when outdoors, with the exception of pregnant Soldiers, they will wear the cardigan buttoned. Soldiers will wear the collar of the smock outside the sweater so rank is visible. When a cold-weather coat or other authorized cold-weather outer garments are worn, personnel may wear the olive-green scarf and the utility gloves, but they are not required to do so. Personnel may wear the optional purchase, black windbreaker (see para 20–30), except in formation. Black oxford shoes or combat boots are worn with the food service uniforms, unless CTA 50–900 authorizes other footwear. Soldiers will not blouse the trousers when wearing boots. Soldiers will wear either black socks or sheer stockings with the black oxfords, with the pantsuit, or with the tunic with slacks. Sheer stockings are worn with the food service uniform dresses. The slacks are not bloused when wearing boots.

c. The food service supervisor may wear the white blouse, black slacks or skirt, black oxford shoes, and the beret, when authorized by the commander. Food service supervisors may wear the black unisex cardigan buttoned or unbuttoned while indoors; when outdoors, they will button the sweater. The black belt with brass buckle is worn with this uniform. The food inspector’s smock is authorized for wear with the food service supervisor uniform only while in the dining facility.

d. The food service utility and food service supervisor uniforms are organizationally issued utility uniforms. However, Soldiers retain these uniforms for as long as they are assigned to food service duties.

e. Issuing the food service maternity uniform to female personnel has no bearing on issuing the maternity service uniform (chap 15) or the maternity work uniform (chap 5).
