<strong>Note:</strong> <em>This paragraph is punitive with regard to Soldiers. Violation by Soldiers may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provisions of the UCMJ.</em>

<strong>a.</strong> Soldiers may wear a wristwatch, a wrist identification bracelet, and a total of two rings (a wedding set is considered one ring) with Army uniforms, <strong>unless prohibited by the commander for safety or health reasons.</strong> 

Soldiers may also wear one activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate monitor. 

<strong>Any jewelry or monitors worn by Soldiers while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty must be conservative.</strong> 

Identification bracelets are limited to medical alert bracelets, and missing in action, prisoner of war, or killed in action (black or silver in color only) bracelets. Soldiers are only authorized to wear one item on each wrist while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty. 

An activity tracker, pedometer, or heart rate monitor may be worn, in addition to the one item (watch or identification bracelet) authorized to be worn on each wrist.

<strong>b.</strong> No jewelry, other than that described in paragraph 3–4a or 3–4d, below, can appear exposed while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty. Pens and/or pencils worn in the pen/pencil slots on the combat uniform coat may be exposed. There are no stipulations on the colors of pens and/or pencils worn in the slots on the combat uniform coat while wearing the uniform. 

Watch chains or similar items cannot appear exposed. The only other authorized exceptions are religious items described in DA Pam 670–1 and AR 600–20; a conservative tie tack or tie clasp that male Soldiers may wear with necktie; and a pen or pencil that may appear exposed on the hospital duty, food service, combat vehicle crewman, or flight uniforms.

<strong>c.</strong> Attaching, affixing or displaying objects, articles, jewelry, or ornamentation to, through, or under their skin, tongue, or any other body part is prohibited (this includes earrings for male Soldiers). This applies to all Soldiers on or off duty. The only exception is for female Soldiers, who may wear earrings consistent with paragraph 3–4d. (The term “skin” is not confined to external skin but includes the tongue, lips, inside the mouth, and other surfaces of the body not readily visible.)

<strong>d.</strong> Females are authorized to wear earrings with the service, dress, and mess uniforms.

<ol><li>Earrings may be screw-on, clip-on, or post-type earrings in gold, silver, white pearl, or diamond. The earrings will not exceed 6 mm or 1⁄4 inch in diameter, and they must be unadorned and spherical. When worn, the earrings will fit snugly against the ear. Females may wear earrings only as a matched pair, with only one earring per ear lobe.</li>
<li>Females are not authorized to wear earrings with any Class C uniform (combat, utility, hospital duty, food service, physical fitness, field, or organizational).</li>
<li>When in civilian clothes on duty, female Soldiers must comply with the specifications listed in paragraph (1), when wearing earrings, unless otherwise authorized by the commander.</li>
<li>When females are not in uniform and off duty, earring wear is not restricted as long as the earrings do not create or support ear gauging (enlarged holes in the lobe of the ear, greater than 1.6mm).</li></ol>

<strong>e.</strong> Ankle bracelets, toe rings, necklaces (other than those described in AR 600–20), faddish (trendy) devices, medallions, amulets, and personal talismans or icons are not authorized for wear while in uniform or in civilian clothes on duty.

<strong>f.</strong> The use of gold caps, platinum caps, or caps of any unnatural color or texture (permanent or removable) for purposes of dental ornamentation is prohibited. Teeth, whether natural, capped, or veneered, will not be decorated with designs, jewels, initials, or similar ornamentation. Unnatural shaping of teeth for nonmedical reasons is prohibited.

Commanders may consider waivers for permanent caps that were applied prior to the effective date of this regulation. Such waivers must be approved by the first O–5 commander in the chain of command and documented in an official memorandum, which must be uploaded to the Soldier’s AMHRR. A picture of the permanent caps must be appended as an enclosure to the memorandum.
