<h4 id="3-1">3–1. Personal appearance policies</h4>

<ol>
 	<li>Soldiers will present a professional image at all times and will continue to set the example in military presence, both on and off duty. Pride in appearance includes Soldiers’ physical fitness and adherence to acceptable weight standards in accordance with AR 600–9.</li>
 	<li>A vital ingredient of the Army’s strength and military effectiveness is the pride and self discipline that American Soldiers bring to their Service through a conservative military image. It is the responsibility of commanders to ensure that military personnel under their command present a neat and soldierly appearance. Therefore, in the absence of specific procedures or guidelines, commanders must determine a Soldier’s compliance with standards in this regulation.</li>
 	<li>The Army uniform regulations for standards of personal appearance and grooming are as specific as is practicable in order to establish the parameters with which Soldiers must comply.</li>
 	<li>Portions of this chapter are punitive. Violation of the specific prohibitions and requirements set forth in this chapter may result in adverse administrative action and/or charges under the provision of the UCMJ.</li>
