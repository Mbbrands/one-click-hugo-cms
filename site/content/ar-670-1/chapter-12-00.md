<h4 id="12-1">12–1: Classification</h4>

<strong>The physical fitness uniforms authorized for wear are classified as:</strong>

b. The Army fitness physical uniform (APFU) (see paras 12–7 through 12–11). The mandatory possession date for this uniform is 1 October 2017.

<h2>Section I: The Improved Physical Fitness Uniform</h2>

<h4 id="">12-: Composition</h4>

<strong>The IPFU consists of the following components (see figs 12–1 and 12–2 for variations of the IPFU):</strong>

a. Jacket, running, gray and black, with “Army” in black.
b. Pants, running, black.
c. Trunks, running, black, with “Army” in reflective white.
d. T-shirt, gray, short sleeve, with “Army” in reflective black.
e. T-shirt, gray, long sleeve, with “Army” in reflective black.
f. Footwear.
g. Socks.


<h4 id="">12-: Accessories</h4>

<strong>The following accessories are normally worn with the IPFU:</strong>

a. Gloves.
b. Fleece cap, foliage green or black (see para 4–10c).

<h4 id="">12-: Materials</h4>

The IPFU shirts consist of 100% moisture wicking polyester. The IPFU shorts consist of 100% nylon with an antimicrobial finished polyester lining. The IPFU jacket and pants consist of 100% nylon.

<h4 id="">12-: Insignia</h4>

The only insignia authorized for wear on the IPFU is the physical fitness badge. When the physical fitness badge is worn, it is sewn on the upper left front side of the IPFU t-shirt. On the IPFU running jacket, the insignia is sewn centered and 1/2 inch above the word “Army.” See AR 600–8–22 for criteria for wearing the physical fitness badge.

<h4 id="">12-6: General guidelines</h4>

a. Personnel wear the green or black micro fleece cap pulled down snugly on the head with the bottom edge covering the ears, but not covering the eyebrows. The bottom edge (all) of the cap may be folded, but not rolled.

b. Commanders may authorize wear of commercial running shoes with calf-length or ankle-length, plain white socks (no logos). If worn, ankle-length socks must cover the entire ankle bone. Shoes must accommodate all five toes in one compartment. Those shoes that feature five separate, individual compartments for the toes detract from a professional military image and are prohibited for wear with the IPFU or when conducting physical training in a military formation.

c. Commanders may authorize wear of utility gloves, reflective belts or vests, long underwear, and other items appropriate to the weather conditions and type of activity. If Soldiers wear long underwear or other similar items, they must conceal them from view with the running jacket and pants if wearing the IPFU.

d. Soldiers are authorized to wear commercially purchased gray or black spandex shorts under the IPFU shorts. The length of the shorts must end above the knee or higher. The commercial shorts must be plain, with no logos, patterns, or obtrusive markings. Soldiers are not required to buy the spandex shorts.

e. When Soldiers wear the IPFU as a complete uniform, they will keep the sleeves down on the jacket, the legs down on the pants, and they will tuck the t-shirt inside the trunks. Soldiers may not roll or push up the sleeves of the IPFU jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Soldiers may not cuff the IPFU jacket sleeves or long-sleeved shirt. There are no restrictions on the combination of IPFU items worn, unless the commander has prescribed a particular combination for formation.

f. The IPFU is a clothing bag item. Each item of the IPFU is identified with a national stock number and a Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support contract number printed on a label and sewn into the garment. If the label does not contain this information, the garment is not an authorized garment.

g. Pregnant Soldiers will wear the IPFU until the uniform becomes too small or uncomfortable. Pregnant Soldiers are authorized to wear the t-shirt outside the trunks. At no time will commanders require pregnant Soldiers to purchase a larger IPFU to accommodate the pregnancy. When the uniform becomes too small or uncomfortable, pregnant Soldiers may wear equivalent civilian workout clothes.

h. Soldiers are not authorized to mix the wear of the IPFU components (see paras 12–2a through 12–2e) with the wear of the APFU (see paras 12–7a through 12–7e) at the same time.

APFU clothing bag items and APFU option purchase items may be mixed and worn together at the same time.

f. The APFU is a clothing bag item, which will replace the IPFU. Each item of the APFU is identified with a national stock number and a Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support contract number printed on a label and sewn into the garment. If the label does not contain this information, the garment is not an authorized garment.

g. Pregnant Soldiers will wear the APFU until the uniform becomes too small or uncomfortable. Pregnant Soldiers are authorized to wear the t-shirt outside the trunks. At no time will commanders require pregnant Soldiers to purchase a larger APFU to accommodate the pregnancy.
