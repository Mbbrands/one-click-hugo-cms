(1) General officers wear a cuff of white mohair or mercerized cotton braid 4 inches in width, positioned 1/8 inch from the bottom edge of each sleeve. General officer grade insignia is centered on the outside of the sleeves, 1 inch above the upper edge of the cuff braid. When general officers wear their branch insignia, it is centered on the outside of the sleeves, 1 inch above the upper edge of the cuff braid. Grade insignia is positioned 1 inch above the branch insignia. If branch insignia is worn, general officers will wear the non-subdued, metal pin-on insignia. Grade insignia is embroidered white cloth or silver bullion. General officer stars are 1 inch in diameter and are worn with one point facing upward. 

<strong>The following describes general officer stars:</strong>

A trefoil is attached to the upper edge of the braid on each sleeve. It consists of a knot composed of three loops, one large upper loop and two small lower loops of 1/4-inch white soutache braid, interlaced at the points of crossing, with the ends of the knots resting on the sleeve braid. Officer grade insignia (non-subdued pin-on or embroidered white cloth) is worn vertically in the center of the space formed by the lower curves of the knot and the upper edge of the braid (see figs 18–8 and 18–9).
