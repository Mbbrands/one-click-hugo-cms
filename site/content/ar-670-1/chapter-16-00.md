Two 25-ligne buttons, joined by a small gold or gold-colored chain about 1 1/2 inches long, are worn in the upper buttonholes. The shoulders have a device for attaching shoulder knots on officer uniforms.

The shoulder knot is formed of four plaits composed of three cords interlaced as one, and rounded at the top with a gold 20-ligne button positioned in the upper end of the knot. The knot is no more than 5 1/2 inches in length and 2 1/2 inches in width, conforming to the shoulder, and stiffened on the underside with a flexible backing, covered with dark blue or black cloth. The flexible backing has an attachment that is suitable for fastening it to the shoulders of the jacket (see fig 16–4).

A band of oak leaves in groups of two, 1 inch in width, are embroidered on each cuff of braid, 1 inch below the upper edge, in gold bullion, synthetic metallic gold, or gold- colored nylon or rayon. General officer grade insignia is centered on the outside sleeve 1 inch above the upper edge of the cuff braid. When general officers wear their branch insignia, it is centered on the outside of the sleeves, 1 inch above the upper edge of the cuff braid.

Grade insignia is positioned 1 inch above the branch insignia. If branch insignia is worn, general officers will wear the nonsubdued, metal pin-on insignia. Grade insignia is embroidered silver bullion. General officer stars are 1 inch in

The bottom of the braid is positioned parallel to, and 3 inches above, the bottom edge of each sleeve. A trefoil is attached to the upper edge of the braid on each sleeve. It consists of a knot composed of three loops, one large upper loop and two small lower loops of 1/4 inch gold, synthetic metallic gold, or gold colored braid, interlaced at the points of crossing, with the ends of the knots resting on the sleeve braid. Officer grade insignia (nonsubdued pin-on or embroidered silver bullion) is worn vertically in the center of the space formed by the lower curves of the knot and the upper edge of the braid (see figs 16–9 and 16–10).
