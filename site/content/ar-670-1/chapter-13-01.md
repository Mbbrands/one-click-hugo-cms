b. Soldiers will not wear those awards and decorations on the shirt that they cannot wear properly because of size or configuration. Commanders will not require the wear of optional items (such as windbreakers or sweaters) unless such items are provided to the Soldier without cost.

c. Soldiers may purchase and wear the service/dress uniform in any of the authorized fabrics listed in paragraph 13–12, above. However, individuals who purchase uniforms or uniform items from commercial sources are responsible for ensuring that the items conform to military specifications, or are manufactured in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Uniform Quality Control Program (see AR 670–1 for details). Only those alterations authorized by AR 700–84 and TM 10–227 are authorized.

d. Soldiers will wear these uniforms with the shirt tucked into the trousers so that the shirt edge is aligned with the front fly opening, so the outside edge of the belt buckle forms a straight “gig line.” Only Soldiers authorized to wear the tan, green, or maroon beret, those assigned to air assault coded positions; and MPs performing MP duties may wear bloused (tucked-in or by using blousing rubbers or bands) trousers with black leather combat boots.

e. The service dress tropical uniform (Class B with ribbons) is an equivalent Class A or dress uniform for hot weather wear. It serves as appropriate wear for parades, ceremonies, reviews (when special honors are being paid), and official visits of U.S. Foreign Dignitaries.

In lieu of wearing all authorized ribbons, Soldiers have the option of wearing only three authorized ribbons. Selected ribbons must be worn in order of precedence (for example, Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart).

Badges and insignia currently authorized for wear on the ASU are authorized to be worn on this variation of the uniform. In lieu of wearing all authorized ribbons, Soldiers have the option of wearing three authorized ribbons on the service uniform shirt.

(2) Personnel are not required to wear headgear when wearing the blue uniform as a formal uniform to formal evening social functions (after retreat). However, on all other occasions, personnel will wear headgear with this uniform.

g. Proper wear position. The service cap is worn straight on the head so that the braid hatband on the service cap creates a straight line around the head, parallel to the ground. Such positioning automatically positions the visor correctly, so that it does not interfere with vision or ride up on the forehead. Personnel will not alter the shape of the service cap in any manner.
