<h2 id="6-9">6-9: Aircrew combat uniform coat</h2>

a. The trousers have a covered front slide fastener fly closure, two adjustable waist straps, hemmed legs, and seven evenly spaced belt loops with a 2 1/4-inch opening. The waistband has a button and buttonhole closure. There are single layer patches at the knees and seat. The trousers contain nine pockets: two side-hanging pockets, two thigh pockets with narrow pleats, two calf (lower leg) pockets-the left calf pocket only has an internal bellowed pocket and both pockets have external tool pockets, and one knife pocket with lanyard (on the left thigh). All pockets (except the side hanging pockets and the internal left-calf pocket) have flaps and slide fastener closures. The left thigh pocket has a front edge opening while all other pockets have a top opening. The leg pocket slides closed as follows: upward for the left thigh pocket and toward the outer seam on all other pockets. The knife pocket has bound edges and an integrated flap with a snap closure. The side hanging pocket closes with two strips of hook-and-loop fastener tape. For blousing purposes, there are tabs with hook-and-loop tape closures on the lower legs.

When not performing flight duties and the trousers are bloused, Soldiers will use the hook-and- pile straps (if the trousers are not tucked into the boots). Personnel will not wrap the trouser legs around the leg tightly enough to present a pegged appearance. Soldiers will not blouse the boots so that the trouser leg extends down to the ankle area. When bloused, the trousers should not extend below the third eyelet from the top of the boot.
