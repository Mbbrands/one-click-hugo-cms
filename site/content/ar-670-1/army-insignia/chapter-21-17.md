(d) The Chief of Staff, Army must approve the authorization for wearing the SSI for FWTS. 

<strong>Note: Units are not authorized to modify their SSI or SSI–FWTS without prior approval from the DCS, G-1. A mirror image SSI-FWTS is considered a modification.

(4) Soldiers of all Army components (Active, ARNG, and USAR) who deploy during periods of service designated for wear of the SSI-FWTS are authorized to wear a SSI-FWTS. There are no time-in-theater requirements for authorization to wear the SSI-FWTS. Soldiers may not earn more than one SSI-FWTS during the same deployment.

(a) A deployed unit (company or higher) will wear its unit SSI as the SSI-FWTS, regardless of the headquarters element deploying and the unit alignment or OPCON during the period of deployment.

(b) A deployed unit will not wear its assigned SSI as its SSI-FWTS when the SSI belongs to a major command, such as an ACOM/ASCC/DRU or State Area Command, or a non-deployable unit. In such cases, the unit will wear the SSI of the lowest echelon Army unit (company or higher) in the deployed chain of command as the SSI-FWTS. When there is no intermediate unit (company or higher) in the deployed chain of command, these deployed Soldiers will wear the SSI of the senior command in the theater as its SSI-FWTS.

Soldiers who deploy with their unit (company level or higher) will wear the SSI-FWTS as outlined in paragraph 21–17a(7)(a), regardless how many times they are further attached to other units as individuals or teams.
