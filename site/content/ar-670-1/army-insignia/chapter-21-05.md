<strong>(1) Nonsubdued.</strong>

(a) The appropriate number of stars is worn centered on the shoulder loops, equidistant between the outside edge of the shoulder loop and the outer edge of the shoulder loop button on the Army green uniform coat, the all-weather coat, and the windbreaker. Stars are worn “point to V” on shoulder loops (see fig 21–28).

As an option, general officers may mount full-sized, medium, or miniature stars on a bar for wear on coats, jackets, and the beret. When this option is chosen, the bar is worn centered on the shoulder loop or beret flash.

<strong>(2) Subdued.</strong> The subdued grade insignia point-to-point stars are worn on the headgear as prescribed in paragraph
