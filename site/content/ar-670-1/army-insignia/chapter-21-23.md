<strong>a. Authorization.</strong> Soldiers wear regimental distinctive insignia when affiliated with a regiment or whole-corps regiment (based on a Soldier’s branch/corps/special branch as determined by PMOS or specialty).

<strong>b. How worn.</strong>

<strong>(1) Males.</strong>

(a) On the service (green or blue) uniforms and the service uniform shirts, males wear the RDI centered 1/8 inch above the top of the pocket flap or 1/4 inch above any unit awards or foreign badges that are worn (see fig 21–136).

When the coat lapel obscures the insignia, Soldiers may wear the RDI aligned to the right edge of unit awards or the nameplate. Wearing the RDI on the service uniform shirt is optional.

(b) On the white and blue mess and evening mess uniforms, male personnel wear the RDI on the right lapel. On the blue mess uniform, the RDI is worn centered on the satin facing, 1/2 inch below the notch in the lapel. On the white mess uniform, the RDI is worn 1/2 inch below the notch, centered on the lapel. The RDI is worn so that the vertical axis of the insignia is perpendicular to the ground (see fig 21–137).

<strong>(2) Females.</strong>

(a) On the green and blue uniforms, the service uniform shirts, and maternity tunic, females wear the RDI centered 1/2 inch above the nameplate or 1/4 inch above any unit awards or foreign badges that are worn. When the coat lapel obscures the RDI, Soldiers may wear the RDI aligned to the right edge of unit awards or the nameplate. Wearing the RDI on the service uniform shirt is optional.

(b) On the blue mess and evening mess, and the new version white mess and evening mess uniforms, females wear the RDI centered on the right lapel, with the top of the RDI aligned with the top row of miniature medals. On the old version white mess and evening mess uniforms, females wear the RDI centered on the right side of the jacket (not on the lapels). The RDI is centered between the lapel and shoulder seam, with the top of the RDI aligned with the top row of miniature medals. The RDI is worn so that the vertical axis is perpendicular to the ground.

(3) Regimental distinctive insignia and distinctive unit insignia. The RDI and DUI will be the same for Soldiers who are assigned to, and affiliated with, the same unit. Soldiers who are assigned to a unit or agency not authorized a DUI will wear the RDI on the beret and the black pullover cardigan in lieu of a DUI.
