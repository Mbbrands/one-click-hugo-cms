a. As used in this paragraph, the word “collar” refers to that part of the coat or shirt (around the neck) that forms a neckband and turnover piece. Bold borders on figures 21–120 through 21–121 depict the collar area. The word “lapel” is used when referring to the fold of the front of the coat that is a continuation of the collar (usually separated by a notch in the collar).

<h4>b. Nonsubdued branch insignia.</h4>

<strong>(1) Male officers.</strong> On the Army green and blue coats, male officers wear their branch insignia centered on both lapels, 1 1/4 inches below the U.S. insignia. The branch insignia is positioned so that the centerline of the insignia bisects the centerline of the U.S. insignia and is parallel to the inside edge of the lapel (see fig 21–117). On the hospital duty uniform, male officers wear their branch insignia centered between the inside edge and the outside edge on the left collar, 1 inch from the lower edge of the collar, with the centerline of the insignia parallel to the lower edge of the collar (see fig 21–118). Except for chaplains, male officers will not wear their branch insignia on the service uniform short- or long- sleeved shirts. Chaplains wear their branch insignia centered immediately over the left breast pocket (see fig 21–119). On the black pullover sweater, chaplains will wear their branch insignia centered above the nameplate, in lieu of the DUI.

<strong>(2) Male enlisted personnel.</strong> On the Army green and blue coats, enlisted males wear their branch insignia centered on the left collar, with the bottom of the disk approximately 1 inch above the notch, with the centerline of the insignia parallel to the inside edge of the lapel (see fig 21–120).

<strong>(3) Female officers.</strong> On the old versions of the Army blue coats, female officers wear branch insignia on the left collar. The insignia is worn 1 inch above the notch, so the centerline of the insignia bisects the notch and is parallel to the inside edge of the collar (see fig 21–121). On the Army green coat and the new versions of the Army blue coats, female officers wear branch insignia on both lapels. The insignia is worn approximately 1 1/4 inches below the U.S. insignia, with the insignia bisecting the U.S. insignia and parallel to the inside edge of the lapel (see fig 21–122). On the hospital duty uniform, female officers wear the branch insignia centered on the left collar, 1 inch up from the lower edge of the collar, with the centerline of the insignia parallel to the lower edge of the collar. Except for chaplains, female officers will not wear branch insignia on the service uniform short- or long-sleeved shirts. Female chaplains wear the branch insignia in a location similar to that described for male chaplains (see para12–12a(1)). On the black pullover sweater, chaplains wear their branch insignia centered above the nameplate, in lieu of the DUI.

<strong>(4) Female enlisted.</strong> On the old versions of the Army blue coat, enlisted females wear branch insignia on the left collar. The insignia is worn 1 inch above the notch and centered, with the centerline of the insignia bisecting the notch, and parallel to the inside edge of the collar (see fig 21–123). On the Army green coat and the new versions of the Army blue coat, enlisted females wear their branch insignia on the left collar. The insignia is worn so the bottom of the disk is centered between the outside edge and inside edge of the collar, approximately 5/8 inch up from center of the collar and lapel seam, with the centerline of the branch insignia parallel to the inside edge of the lapel (see fig 21–124).
