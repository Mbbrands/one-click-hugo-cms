(1) Enlisted personnel wear the DUI on the service uniform coat, centered on the shoulder loops an equal distance from the outside shoulder seam to the outside edge of the button, with the base of the insignia toward the outside shoulder seam. Enlisted personnel are not authorized to wear the DUI on the dress uniform (worn with white shirt and necktie/neck tab).
