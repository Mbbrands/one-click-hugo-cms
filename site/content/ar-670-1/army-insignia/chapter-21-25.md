<strong>a. Insignia, distinguishing, U.S. Army tape.</strong>

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> For the combat utility uniforms and ECWCS, the insignia is 5 inches in length with the individual’s last name on a hook- and-loop-faced pad and the inscription “U.S. Army” in black block letters sewn on a camouflaged pattern tape to match the uniform. The letters are 3/4 inch high and 1/2 inch wide.

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong> The “U.S. Army” is worn on the wear’s left breast pocket immediately above and parallel with the top of the slanted chest pocket flap (see fig 21–138). The background of the U.S. Army insignia is a camouflage pattern. When personnel sew on badges, the following must also be sewn on the utility uniform coat: nametape, U.S. Army tape, and grade insignia. This requirement does not apply to the patrol cap. If a Soldier sews on a U.S. Army tape, nametape, or grade insignia, then all three items must be sewn on.

<strong>Note. Personnel will not wear the U.S. Army insignia tape on the hospital duty and food service uniforms. Personnel are not
authorized to have the words U.S. Army embroidered directly on the uniform.</strong>

<strong>b. Insignia, nametape.</strong>

The letters are 3/4 inch high and 1/2 inch wide. No punctuation, symbols, or special characters are authorized on the nametape. (Last names consisting of 11 letters or more are constructed using Franklin gothic extra-condensed print (48 point), 1/2 inch high.)

Personnel are not authorized to wear the nametape in any other location on the parka other than the pocket flap, and they are not authorized to embroider the name directly on the pocket flap.

<strong>(2) How to obtain.</strong> Initial and replacement nametapes are provided at no cost to enlisted members and are procured from appropriated funds.
