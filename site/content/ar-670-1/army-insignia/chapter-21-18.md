All Soldiers will wear the full-color U.S. flag embroidered insignia on utility and organizational uniforms, unless deployed or in a field environment. Soldiers will wear the subdued tactical flag insignia while deployed or in a field environment.

<strong>a. Description.</strong> The colors of the U.S. flag embroidered insignia (full color) are red, white, and blue. The size is approximately 2 inches by 3 inches.

<strong>b. How worn.</strong>

(1) The U.S. flag insignia (full color or subdued) is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of utility uniforms and
cold-weather jackets. The flag insignia is placed directly on top of the hook-and-loop-faced-pad already provided on
the uniforms shoulder pocket flap. The subdued U.S. flag insignia is worn as directed by the commander under tactical
field conditions.

(2) The U.S. flag embroidered insignia is worn so that the star field faces forward, or to the flag’s own right. When
worn in this manner, the flag is facing to the observer’s right and gives the effect of the flag flying in the breeze as the wearer moves forward. The appropriate replica for the right shoulder sleeve is identified as the reverse side flag (see fig 21–132)
