<strong>a. Description.</strong> The nonsubdued OCS insignia consists of the block letters “O.C.S.” in gold-colored metal, 7/16 inch in height, with each letter followed by a period. The subdued insignia is the same design as above, except it is black (see fig 21–126).

<strong>b. How worn.</strong> Officer candidates wear their insignia as follows:

(1) On service and dress uniform coats, male candidates wear the insignia on both collars, 1 inch above the notch, with the centerline of the insignia bisecting the notch, and parallel to the inside edge of the lapel. Female candidates wear the insignia in the same manner as the U.S. insignia. It is centered on both collars, approximately 5/8 inch up from the collar and lapel seam, with the centerline of the insignia parallel to the inside edge of the lapel. On the male and female service uniform shirt collars, the insignia is worn on both collars, 1 inch above the point of the collar, with the centerline of the insignia bisecting the point of the collar (see figs 21–127 and 21–128).

(2) Headgear insignia for service hats and caps are the same as prescribed for enlisted personnel (see fig 21–3 and fig 21–5).

(3) Senior candidates may wear the cloth O.C.S. design on the ascot (see fig 21–129).
