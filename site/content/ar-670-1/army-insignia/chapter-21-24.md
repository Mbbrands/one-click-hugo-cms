<strong>a. Authorization.</strong> AR 670–1 authorizes insignia used to represent regimental affiliation to consist of either the RDI or DUI. A Soldier’s Regimental affiliation using an RDI is based on a Soldier’s branch/corps/special branch as determined by PMOS or specialty. A Soldier’s Regimental affiliation using a DUI is based on a unit in which the Soldier is serving or previously successfully served. Soldiers may wear the RDI for their affiliated regiment or may wear the DUI for a unit in which they are serving or have previously successfully served based off their assignment history as indicated in their personnel record.

<strong>b. How worn.</strong> The RDI or DUI, when worn as insignia to represent regimental affiliation, are worn as outlined in paragraph 21–23.
