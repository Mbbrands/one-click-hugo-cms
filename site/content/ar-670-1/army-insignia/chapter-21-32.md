<h3>a. Organizational flash.</h3>

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> A shield-shaped embroidered patch worn on the beret, with a semicircular bottom, approximately 2 1/4 inches long and 1 7/8 inches wide.

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong> The flash is sewn centered on the stiffener of the beret (see para 21–3c).

<strong>(3) Authorized wearers.</strong> See AR 670–1.

<h3>b. Airborne background trimming.</h3>

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> An oval-shaped embroidered device in distinctive colors, 1 3/8 inches in height and 2 1/4 inches in
width.

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong>

(a) Personnel wear the background trimming beneath any of the authorized parachutist or air assault badges on the green and blue service coats and the service uniforms shirt. The basic portion of the badge is centered on the background trimming; however, the wreath and star on the master and senior parachutist badges project slightly above the background trimming. On the AG 415 shirt when ribbons are worn, all personnel wear the trimming so the bottom edge of the trimming is 1/4 inch above the ribbons. When ribbons are not worn, males wear the trimming 1/4 inch above the pocket seam, and females wear the trimming in a comparable position.

(b) On the green and blue service coats, males wear the background trimming and applicable badge on the pocket flap so the space between the seam of the pocket flap and the top of the background trimming, wreath, or star is 1/8 inch (see fig 21–159). Females wear the trimming and applicable badge on the green and blue service coats and the maternity uniform tunic so the bottom edge of the background trimming is 1/4 inch above the ribbons (see fig 21–160). When worn below the ribbons, the top of the background trimming is 1/4 inch below the bottom ribbon row.

<strong>(3) Authorized wearers. See AR 670–1.</strong>

<h3>c. Cord, shoulder, marksmanship.</h3>

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> A blue cord, 3/16 inch in diameter, bearing a band composed of serrated markings at 9/16-inch intervals. Each marking consists of 1/16-inch white, 1/16-inch red, and 1/16-inch white markings. The overall length of the shoulder cord will not exceed 52 inches (includes double cord).

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong> The shoulder cord is worn on the right shoulder of the green and blue uniform coats and the service uniforms shirt, when it is worn as an outer garment. The cord is passed under the arm and over the right shoulder, under the shoulder loops, and secured to the button on the shoulder loop.
