a. AR 670–1 identifies leaders authorized to wear leaders identification insignia.

b. The LI insignia is a green cloth loop, 1 5/8 inches wide, worn in the middle of both shoulder loops on the Army green coat, and on the center tab of the ECWCS (Gore-Tex®) parka. When the LI is worn on the parka, personnel wear their grade insignia centered on the LI. Personnel may wear pin-on grade insignia, or they may sew onto the LI the same cloth grade insignia that is worn on the uniform (see fig 21–133). Soldiers are not authorized to wear the LI insignia on utility uniforms.

c. Personnel will not wear the LI when reassigned from a command position, or from an organization designated above, or when taking an official photo.
