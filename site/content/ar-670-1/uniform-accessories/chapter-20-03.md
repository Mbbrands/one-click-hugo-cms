<strong>a. Boots, combat, tan or coyote, leather.</strong> The Army combat boots (HW and temperate weather) are clothing bag issue items.

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> The two types of issue Army combat boots (HW and temperate weather) are made of flesh-side out cattlehide leather with a plain toe and tan or coyote outsoles. Soldiers are required to possess two pairs of issue Army combat boots (HW) and one pair of issue Army combat boots (temperate weather) (specification) boots.

(a) The issue Army combat boot, HW, is made of tan or coyote colored, flesh-side out cattlehide leather and nylon duck upper, removable cushioned insert, a closed loop speed lace system, and drainage eyelets.

(b) The issue Army combat boot, temperate weather, is made of tan or coyote colored, flesh-side out cattlehide leather and nylon upper, a weatherproof-breathable membrane with limited flame resistance, conduction heat resistance and liquid fuel penetration protection, removable insert, and a closed loop speed lace system.

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong>

(a) The boots are laced diagonally; the color of the boot laces will match the color of the boot, with the excess lace tucked into the top of the boot under the bloused trousers or slacks, or wrapped around the top of the boot. Metal or plastic cleats and side tabs are not authorized for wear. Sewn-in or laced-in zipper or hook-and-loop inserts are not authorized.

(b) Rubber or pure polyether polyurethane soles are the only outsole material that currently meets the need for durability and traction on surfaces in multiple environments and temperature ranges. Other materials (that may be of a lighter weight) may have significant problems in these areas.

<strong>(3) Optional boots.</strong>

(a) As an option, Soldiers may wear commercial boots of a design similar to that of the Army combat boot (tan or coyote), as authorized by the commander. The boots must be between 8 to 10 inches in height and made of tan or coyote flesh-side out cattlehide leather, with a plain toe and a soling system matching the color of the tan or coyote upper materials. Rubber and polyether polyurethane are the only outsole materials that are authorized. The soling materials will not exceed 2 inches in height, when measured from the bottom of the outsole, and will not extend up the back of the heel or boot or over the top of the toe. The exterior of the boot upper will not contain mesh but will be constructed of either all leather or a combination of leather and nonmesh fabric. Soldiers may wear optional boots in lieu of the Army combat boot (tan), as authorized by the commander; however, they do not replace issue boots as a mandatory possession item.

(b) Optional boots are not authorized for wear when the commander issues and prescribes standard organizational footwear for safety or environmental reasons (such as insulated boots or safety shoes). Personnel may wear specialty boots authorized for wear by specific groups of Soldiers, such as the tanker boot, only if the commander authorizes such wear. Soldiers may not wear optional boots in formation when uniformity in appearance is required.

<strong>(4) Organizational boots.</strong> When prescribed and issued by the commander according to CTA 50â€“900, personnel may wear, instead of the combat boot, such organizational boots or safety boots with field and utility uniforms.

<strong>b. Boots, combat: black, leather.</strong> The black combat boots are an optional purchase item.

<strong>(1) Description.</strong> The black boot is made of black leather with a deep lug tread sole made of vulcanized rubber, a removable cushioned insert, a closed-loop speed lace system, and a leather padded collar.

<strong>(2) How worn.</strong>

(a) Only Soldiers authorized to wear the tan, green, or maroon berets, those assigned to Air Assault coded positions, and MPs performing MP duties may wear black combat boots with the service/dress uniforms. When worn, the trousers or slacks are bloused (tucked-in or by the use of blousing rubbers/bands). When trousers or slacks are bloused, personnel will not wrap them around the leg so tightly so as to present a pegged appearance. When the trousers or slacks are bloused properly, the bloused portion of the trousers or slacks should not extend below the third eyelet from the top of the boot. Soldiers will not blouse boots so that the bloused portion extends down to the ankle area of the boot.

(b) The boots are laced diagonally with black laces, with the excess lace tucked into the top of the boot under the bloused trousers or slacks, or wrapped around the top of the boot. Metal cleats and side tabs are not authorized for wear except by honor guards and ceremonial units in the performance of ceremonial duties. When metal cleats and side tabs are authorized for wear, commanders will furnish them to Soldiers at no cost. Sewn-in or laced-in zipper inserts are not authorized.

(c) A vulcanized rubber sole is the only outsole material that currently meets the need for durability and traction on surfaces. Other materials (that may be of a lighter weight) may have significant problems in these areas.
