b. Soldiers may wear gloves with the combat uniform without the cold-weather outer garments (for example, GoreTex jacket or field jacket).

c. When the cold-weather coat or other authorized cold-weather outer garments are worn, Soldiers may wear the olive green scarf and gloves, but are not required to do so. Soldiers may wear the hood of the cold-weather coat at their option. However, when the hood is not worn, Soldiers will tuck the hood into the jacket with the zipper closed.

d. The black or green fleece jacket (extended cold weather clothing system (ECWCS)) can be worn as an outer garment when authorized by the commander.

e. Soldiers are authorized to wear elbow or knee pads with the combat uniform.

f. The silk weight (cold-weather) moisture-wicking undershirts are not authorized to be worn under the combat uniform coat in place of the sand, tan 499, or foliage green undershirts. The silk weight (cold-weather) undershirts will be worn as undergarments only.

g. Female personnel may carry purses/handbags with these uniforms only while in a garrison environment. Such bags must comply with standards set forth in AR 670–1, paragraph 3–7f, and paragraph 20–12 of this publication.

h. Commanders may authorize use of a camouflage, black, or solid color (in a similar color to match the shade of uniform) personal hydration system only in the following situations: in a field environment, in high-heat areas, or on work details. Soldiers will not wear hydration systems in a garrison environment unless the commander has authorized it for one of the situations described above. Soldiers will not let the drinking tube hang from their mouths when the device is not in use.

i. Soldiers are authorized to store headgear when it is not worn. Soldiers may store headgear in the cargo pockets. When stored, the headgear must be folded neatly and not present a bulky appearance.

k. The standard combat uniform coat and trousers, both issued and available at military clothing stores, are pretreated with permethrin, which provides protection from disease-carrying insects. Female Soldiers who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or nursing may be able to obtain a temporary medical profile to wear non-permethrin treated combat uniforms, in accordance with the policies and procedures contained in AR 40–501.

l. The following care instructions must be followed when caring for the combat uniform to maximize the service life and maintain optimum performance. <strong>Soldiers will—</strong>

<ul><li>Not starch the combat uniform under any circumstances. Using starch, sizing, and any process that involves dry cleaning or a steam press will adversely affect the treatments and durability of the uniform and is not authorized.</li>
<li>Wash the combat uniform in cold water and mild detergent containing no optical brighteners or bleach.</li>
<li>Tumble dry the combat uniform at low heat (not to exceed 130 degrees Fahrenheit). Remove immediately from
the dryer and fold flat or place on a rustproof hanger to ensure heat from the dryer does not set wrinkles. To drip dry, remove from the washer and place on a rustproof hanger. Do not wring or twist.</li>
<li>Soldiers may roll press uniforms, as necessary.</li></ul>

m. The ACU–Female (ACU–F) is an authorized alternate ACU designed in a wider range of sizes. If worn, it must have the same general appearance and fit as prescribed for the ACU.

n. The Army combat shirt is designed to provide flame protection for individual Soldiers, while maximizing breathability, moisture management, and comfort when worn as a system including interceptor body armor and FR combat uniform trousers or aircrew combat uniform trousers. It will be worn tucked into the trousers. It is designed to be worn next to the skin, without a t-shirt, in hot weather. This does not preclude wear of female undergarments or t-shirts currently approved for wear. This shirt will only be worn in a deployed or field environment, as approved by the commander. The right shoulder sleeve of the shirt is equipped with hook and loop for nametape and grade insignia. The left shoulder sleeve is equipped with hook and loop for the subdued U.S. flag embroidered insignia.

<h4 id="4-8">4-8: Combat uniform coat</h4>

a. The combat uniform coat is worn hooked/looped and/or buttoned and zipped. The coat has hook-and-loop fasteners for wearing the U.S. flag insignia, skills tabs, SSI, SSI- FWTS, rank insignia, U.S. Army tape, and nametape.

The coat has a zippered front closure, tilted chest pockets with hook-and-loop closure, hook-and-loop or button sleeve cuff closure (which must be closed at all times), integrated blouse bellows for increased upper body mobility, and shoulder pockets with hook-and-loop.

b. The mandarin collar will be normally worn in the down position. Soldiers are authorized to wear the mandarin collar in the up position when wearing body armor or when weather conditions dictate the wear, as prescribed by the commander.

c. The coat is normally worn outside the trousers, and the trousers are worn with a belt. The coat may also be worn inside the trousers when directed by the commander (that is, when wearing the outer tactical vest, mission oriented protective posture gear, and so forth). The tan undershirt is worn underneath the coat; it is tucked inside the trousers at all times.

d. The coat will not extend below the top of the cargo pocket on the trousers and will not be higher than the bottom of the opening of the side pocket on the trousers. The elbow pouch with hook-and-loop closure for internal elbow pad inserts must be closed at all times. Permanent infrared feedback squares affixed to each shoulder for nighttime identification will be covered when insignia are not worn on the pocket flaps. Sleeves will be worn down at all times (not rolled or cuffed). The sleeve cuffs on the combat uniform coat are not authorized to be rolled inside the coat.

e. Soldiers may sew on the U.S. Army tape, name tape, rank, and all authorized badges as an option. Hook-and-loop fasteners for U.S. Army tape and name tape may be left on or removed when sewing on the uniform. If worn, badges must be all sewn on or all pinned on; Soldiers are not authorized to mix sew-on badges with pin-on badges. When personnel sew on badges, the following must also be sewn on the combat uniform coat: name tape, U.S. Army tape, and grade insignia. If a nametape, U.S. Army tape or grade insignia is sewn on, then personnel must sew all three of these items on the uniform coat. This requirement does not apply to the patrol cap. If Soldiers choose to sew on U.S. Army name tape, rank or authorized skill badges, it will be at their own expense. Soldiers are not authorized to wear pinned on badges in a field or deployed environment.

<h4 id="4-9">4-9: Combat uniform trousers</h4>

a. Soldiers will wear the trousers tucked into the top of the boots or bloused using the draw strings at the bottom of the trousers or commercial blousing devices. Personnel will not wrap the trouser leg around the leg tightly enough to present a pegged appearance or insert any items inside the trouser leg to create a round appearance at the bottom of the trouser leg.

b. When bloused, the trousers should not extend below the third eyelet from the top of the boot. The knee pouch with hook-and-loop closure for internal knee pad inserts and bellowed calf storage pocket with the hook-and-loop closure on the left and right legs will be worn closed at all times.

<h2 id="4-10">4-10: Headgear</h2>

<h4>a. The patrol cap</h4>

<ol><li><strong>General.</strong> The patrol cap is standard headgear worn with the combat uniform in the garrison environment. The patrol cap has a visor, circular top crown, side crown with an outside crown band, and a hook-and-loop pad on the back of the patrol cap (see fig 4–1).</li>
<li><strong>Wear.</strong> Personnel wear the patrol cap straight on the head so that the cap band creates a straight line around the head, parallel to the ground. The patrol cap will fit snugly and comfortably around the largest part of the head without bulging or distortion from the intended shape of the headgear and without excessive gaps. No rolling of, blocking, or alterations to the cap are authorized. The cap is worn so that no hair is visible on the forehead beneath the cap. The nametape will be worn centered on the hook-and-loop pads on the back of the patrol cap. Soldiers may sew on the nametape and/or grade insignia as an option. Hook-and-loop fasteners for the nametape may be left on or removed when sewing it on to the patrol cap. If Soldiers choose to sew on the name tape or grade insignia, it will be at their own expense.</li></ol>

<h4>b. The beret</h4>

(1) <strong>General.</strong> The black beret is not the standard headgear for wear with the combat uniform. However, commanders retain the authority to prescribe the black beret for special events such as parades or changes of command/responsibility.

<strong>Soldiers wear berets as indicated below:</strong>

<h4>(a) Ranger tan beret</h4>

Soldiers currently assigned to the following units are authorized to wear the Ranger tan beret. 

Personnel will wear the approved flash of the unit to which they are assigned.

<ul><li>75th Ranger Regiment</li>
<li>Ranger Training Brigade</li>
<li>Ranger-qualified Soldiers in the following units or positions, if they previously served in the 75th Ranger
Regiment: U.S. Special Operations Command; U.S. Army Special Operations Command; U.S. Special Operations
Command Joint Task Force; and Theater Special Operations Command. The 75th Ranger Regiment is the sole authority for validation of service in the Ranger Regiment.</li></ul>

<h4>(b) Green beret.</h4> 

All Special Forces-qualified personnel carrying career management field (CMF) 18 military occupational specialties (MOSs), to include 18A or 180A and command sergeants major (CSMs) reclassified from 18Z to OOZ are authorized to wear the green beret. This includes Senior and Junior ROTC instructors and those attending training at an Army Service school in a student status (for example, Command and General Staff College, Defense Language Institute, or the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy). Those in CMF 18 who are filling a drill sergeant position will continue to wear the drill sergeant hat while assigned to a valid drill sergeant position and actively training Soldiers. Soldiers awarded the Special Forces tab, but not branched Special Forces, will only wear the green beret while assigned to a Special Forces unit or position. Special Forces personnel will wear the approved flash of the unit to which they are assigned. Special Forces personnel who are assigned to an organization without an approved flash will wear the generic Special Forces flash (the flash approved for personnel assigned to Special Forces positions but not assigned to Special Forces units).

<h4>(c) Maroon beret</h4> 

All personnel assigned to Airborne units whose primary missions are Airborne operations wear the maroon beret. The Airborne designation for a unit is found in the unit modification table of organization and equipment. Other Soldiers authorized to wear the maroon beret are indicated below. (Personnel will wear the approved flash of the unit to which they are assigned.)

<ol>
<li>Active Army advisors to reserve Airborne units on jump status.</li>
<li>All personnel assigned to the Airborne departments of the U.S. Army Infantry School and the U.S. Army Quartermaster School.</li>
<li>All personnel assigned to long-range surveillance detachments designated as Airborne.</li>

</ol>

(2) <strong>Wear.</strong> The beret is worn so that the headband (edge binding) is straight across the forehead, 1 inch above the eyebrows. The flash is positioned over the left eye, and the excess materials is draped over to the right ear, extending to at least the top of the ear, and no lower than the middle of the ear. Personnel will cut off the ends of the adjusting ribbon and secure the ribbon knot inside the edge binding at the back of the beret. When worn properly, the beret is formed to the shape of the head; therefore, Soldiers may not wear hairstyles that cause distortion of the intended shape of the beret. Paragraph 4–7e, below, addresses wearing headgear insignia. Figure 4–3 shows wear of the beret. The beret is equipped with a stiffener on the left front for attaching organizational flashes and insignia.

<h4>c. The fleece cap</h4> 

The foliage green micro fleece cap or the black fleece cap is worn with the physical fitness uniform or combat uniform in field environments when the Army combat helmet is not worn, on work details, or in other environments where wearing the patrol cap is impractical, as determined by the commander. Personnel wear the fleece cap pulled down snugly on the head. In order to wear the cap properly, the bottom edge (all) of the cap may be folded, but not rolled. Installation commanders will determine temperature, wind chill, and extended duty time warranting wear of the cap in nonfield, nondeployed environments. The wear-out date of the foliage green micro fleece cap is 30 September 2017. The mandatory possession date for the black fleece cap is 1 October 2017.

<h4>d. The sun (boonie) hat</h4> 

The sun hat is worn with the combat uniform in field environments when the advanced combat helmet is not worn, on work details, or in other environments where wearing the patrol cap is impractical, as determined by the commander. Personnel wear the sun hat straight on the head so that the web band creates a straight line around the head, parallel to the ground. The sun hat will fit comfortably around the largest part of the head without distortion or excessive gaps. The sun hat is worn so that no hair is visible on the forehead beneath the hat. The draw string on the sun hat can be worn under the chin, around the back of the head and neck, or tucked inside. The draw string will not be worn over the top of the sun hat. The sun hat will not be worn rolled, formed, shaped, blocked, or with an upturned brim. Sewn-on or pinned-on rank is worn on the sun hat.

<h4>e. Headgear insignia</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beret.</strong> Officers and WOs wear nonsubdued grade insignia centered on the beret flash, and chaplains wear their branch insignia. Enlisted personnel wear their distinctive unit insignia (DUI) centered on the beret flash. Enlisted personnel assigned to units not authorized the DUI wear their regimental distinctive insignia (RDI). General officers may wear full-, medium-, or miniature-sized stars on the beret. Stars are centered horizontally on the flash point-topoint, and they may be mounted on a bar as an option. Overlapping the stars beyond the flash is authorized. See paragraph 21–3 for placement of headgear insignia and beret flashes.</li>
<li><strong>The patrol cap.</strong> Subdued pin-on or sew-on grade insignia is worn on the patrol cap. Enlisted personnel wear subdued grade insignia on the patrol caps and cold-weather utility caps. The grade insignia is centered on the front of the headgear left to right, and top to bottom. Commissioned officers and warrant officers will wear subdued grade insignia. Chaplains wear subdued branch insignia.</li></ul>
