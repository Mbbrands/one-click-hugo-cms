<h2 id="5-6">5-6: Combat and skill badges worn on the maternity work uniform</h2>

Foreign badges are not authorized for wear on the combat uniform. Pin-on badges are not authorized in a field or deployed environment. See paragraphs 5–7n and 22–16 for wear of combat and skill badges on the combat uniform.

<h2 id="5-7">5-7: General guidelines</h2>

a. Soldiers are authorized to wear the sand undershirt and tan combat boots with the UCP and/or OCP maternity work uniform until the wear out date of the UCP ACU. The tan 499 undershirt and coyote boots are not authorized for wear with the UCP maternity work uniform.

b. The standard headgear for this uniform is the patrol cap (see para 4–10).

c. Soldiers may wear gloves with the maternity work uniform without the cold-weather outer garments (for example, Gore-Tex jacket or field jacket).

d. When the cold-weather coat or other authorized cold-weather outer garments are worn, Soldiers may wear the olive green scarf and gloves, but are not required to do so. Soldiers may wear the hood of the cold-weather coat at their option. However, when the hood is not worn, Soldiers will tuck the hood into the jacket with the zipper closed.

e. The black or green fleece jacket (ECWCS) can be worn as an outer garment when authorized by the commander.

f. This uniform is designed to fit loosely; alterations to make the uniform fit tightly are not authorized. A tight fit reduces the airflow needed for ventilation and cooling. The coat is worn outside the trousers. Soldiers will not wear a belt with this uniform. Soldiers will wear the trousers bloused, using the draw cords or blousing rubbers, if the trousers are not tucked into the boots. Personnel will not wrap the trouser legs around the leg tightly enough to present a pegged appearance. Soldiers will not blouse the boots so that the trouser leg extends down to the ankle area. When bloused, the trousers should not extend below the third eyelet from the top of the boot.

g. Soldiers will not starch the maternity work uniform under any circumstances. Using starch, sizing, or any process that involves dry cleaning or a steam press will adversely affect the treatment and durability of the uniform, and it is not authorized.

h. The sleeve cuffs on the maternity work uniform coat are not authorized to be rolled or cuffed inside or outside ofnthe coat.

i. The silk weight (cold-weather) moisture-wicking undershirts are not authorized to be worn under the maternity work uniform coat in place of the sand, tan 499, or foliage green undershirts. The silk weight (cold-weather) undershirts will be worn as undergarments only.

j. Female personnel may carry purses/handbags with these uniforms only while in a garrison environment. Such bags must comply with standards set forth in paragraph 20–12 of this publication and AR 670–1, paragraph 3–7f.

k. Commanders may authorize using a camouflage, black, or solid color (in a similar color to match the shade of uniform) personal hydration system only in the following situations: in a field environment, in high-heat areas, or on work details. Soldiers will not wear hydration systems in a garrison environment unless the commander has authorized it for one of the situations described above. Soldiers will not let the drinking tube hang from their mouths when the device is not in use.

l. Soldiers are authorized to store headgear when it is not worn. Soldiers may store headgear in the cargo pockets. When stored, the headgear must be folded neatly and not present a bulky appearance.

m. The following insignia are not authorized to be worn on the maternity work uniform: blood types, combat lifesavers, medic, allergies, Arabic nametapes, no known drug allergies, no known allergies, penicillin, and so forth.

n. Footgear other than combat boots may be prescribed as needed. Footgear will be conservative, in good taste, and meet the needs of the individual’s profile.

o. When personnel sew on badges, the following must also be sewn on the maternity work uniform coat: name tape, U.S. Army tape, and grade insignia. If a nametape, U.S. Army tape or grade insignia is sewn on, then personnel must sew all three of these items on the uniform coat. This requirement does not apply to the patrol cap.

p. Care instructions are the same as the combat uniform (see para 4–7k).
