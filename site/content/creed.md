<blockquote>

<em>I am an American Soldier.</em>

<em>I am a warrior and a member of a team.</em>

<em>I serve the people of the United States, and live the Army Values.</em>

<em>I will always place the mission first.</em>

<em>I will never accept defeat.</em>

<em>I will never quit.</em>

<em>I will never leave a fallen comrade.</em>

<em>I am disciplined, physically and mentally tough, trained and proficient in my warrior tasks and drills.</em>

<em>I always maintain my arms, my equipment and myself.</em>

<em>I am an expert and I am a professional.</em>

<em>I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy, the enemies of the United States of America in close combat.</em>

<em>I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life.</em>

<em>I am an American Soldier.</em>
